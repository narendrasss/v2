## Problem

Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 16
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 5
Output: false
```

**Follow up**: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Approach

### Naive

My first instinct is to repeatedly divide by 4 until you hit 1:

```jsx
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const isPowerOfFour = function(num) {
    let curr = num
    while (curr !== 1) {
        curr = curr / 4
    }
    return true
};
```

This clearly wouldn't work for inputs that are *not* powers of 4 because it will never get to 1. To fix that we should return false as soon as `curr` becomes a non-integer. Thankfully JS has a built in function to check if a number is an integer or not:

```jsx
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const isPowerOfFour = function(num) {
    let curr = num
    while (curr !== 1) {
        curr = curr / 4
        if (!Number.isInteger(curr)) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
};
```

When I tried submitting this it exceeded the time limit with input 0. After some googling I realize that `Number.isInteger` returns true for 0, so the while loop never terminates.

Easy enough to fix, we know that 0 is not a power of 4 so we add that check at the start:

```jsx
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const isPowerOfFour = function(num) {
    if (num <= 0) {
        return false
    }
    let curr = num
    while (curr !== 1) {
        curr = curr / 4
        if (!Number.isInteger(curr)) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
};
```

We also made it robust to negative numbers by doing `num <= 0` rather than just an equality check. This solution was accepted:

- Beats **58.82%** of JS submissions
- A runtime of **92ms**
- Memory usage of **37.8 MB**

This algorithm scales linearly at $O(n)$ since the `while` loop depends on the size of the number being passed to it. The follow up asks if we can do it without loops or recursion, so let's see how we can improve this.

### Optimized

A better way to check if something is a power of something else is to check its logarithm. If the value is an integer, then it is a power of something else. If it's not, then it's not.

Essentially, we want to do:

```jsx
isPowerOfFour = num => isInteger(log(num)) // to the base 4
```

But the built in JS log function only calculates the natural logarithm â€” to the base $e$. No worries, we can figure it out using the "change of base" logarithm rule:

$log_b(a) = \frac{log_c(b)}{log_c(a)}$

With that, we have our final solution:

```jsx
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const isPowerOfFour = function(num) {
    if (num <= 0) {
        return false
    }
    return Number.isInteger(Math.log(num) / Math.log(4))
};
```

This solution:

- A runtime of **84ms**
- Memory usage of **38.4 MB**
