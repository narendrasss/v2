title: Prison Cells After N Days
difficulty: medium
---

## Problem

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant,Â then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prisonÂ in the following way:Â `cells[i] == 1` if the `i`-th cell is occupied, else `cells[i] == 0`.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after `N` days (and `N` such changes described above.)

**Example 1**

```
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Example 2**

```
Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

## Approach

### Naive

Starting with the brute force approach, my thinking is to iterate through each day, updating the prison cells as we go and finally printing the state of the prison after `N` days.

For each day, go through each cell and determine if it requires updating based on the given rules.

- I would define a helper function that determines whether a particular cell requires updating

```jsx
/**
 * @param {number[]} cells
 * @param {number} N
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const prisonAfterNDays = function(cells, N) {
    let currentState = cells
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        const updates = []
        for (let c = 0; c < cells.length; c++) {
            updates.push(shouldBeOccupied(currentState, c) ? 1 : 0)
        }
        currentState = updates
    }
    return currentState
};

function shouldBeOccupied(cells, cellNumber) {
    const [left, right] = [cells[cellNumber - 1], cells[cellNumber + 1]]
    if (left !== undefined && right !== undefined) {
        return left === right
    }
    return false
}
```

Since the number of cells is constant at 8, this algorithm has a runtime of $O(N)$. Because of this, the algorithm timed out for large values of N.

### Optimized

I tried looking for patterns that would allow us to determine the final state based on the initial state and N alone, but so far I have no leads. Here's what I figured so far:

- Unless N = 0, the first and last cells will *always* be unoccupied in the end because it doesn't have two adjacent neighbors.
  - Optimizing this wouldn't have much effect because we would still have to iterate N times to figure out the end state of all the other cells.
  - **Given this information though, could we take advantage of it somehow?**
- My brute force solution didn't take advantage of the fact that the number of cells is constant. Can we make use of this somehow?

After looking it up (ðŸ˜…), I found that the key insight is to realize the **limited number of states the prison cells could have**.

The example has 8 cells. The leftmost and rightmost cells will always end up being 0, so we can count them out. With 6 cells left and with each cell having two states (occupied and unoccupied), we get $2^6 = 64$ total possible states. If N > 64 then we are guaranteed to see a duplicate at least once.

The problem assumes the number of cells is constant, but we can apply the same logic to however many cells we have e.g. 4 cells â†’ N > 4, 20 cells â†’ N > 2^18 = 262k

Let's say it took us 10 days to find a duplicate. That means it takes us 10 days to hit a cycle, which means we know what the state is in 20 days, and in 30 days, and so forth (it's the same state!). If N happens to be a multiple of 10, then we're done.

Of course it's possible that N is not a multiple of 10. In that case, we have to manually calculate the days for the *remainder* of N divided by 10. But this number will always be < 10, so we still saved a lot of computation time.

More generally, we first have to find a cycle and keep track of how many days has elapsed before we found a cycle. Then, for the remainder of N, we manually calculate the next state.

The final submission:

```jsx
/**
 * @param {number[]} cells
 * @param {number} N
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const prisonAfterNDays = function(cells, N) {
    let currentState = cells
    let hasCycle = false
    let cycleLength = 0
    const seen = new Set()
    
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        const next = nextDay(currentState)
        if (seen.has(next.toString())) {
            hasCycle = true
            break
        } else {
            seen.add(next.toString())
            cycleLength++
        }
        currentState = next
    }
    
    if (hasCycle) {
        const remainingDays = N % cycleLength
        for (let i = 0; i < remainingDays; i++) {
            currentState = nextDay(currentState)
        }
    }
    
    return currentState
};

function nextDay(cells) {
    const updates = []
    for (let c = 0; c < cells.length; c++) {
        updates.push(shouldBeOccupied(cells, c) ? 1 : 0)
    }
    return updates
}

function shouldBeOccupied(cells, cellNumber) {
    const [left, right] = [cells[cellNumber - 1], cells[cellNumber + 1]]
    if (left !== undefined && right !== undefined) {
        return left === right
    }
    return false
}
```

Other notes:

- I used a Set to keep track of the prison states that we have seen so far. I chose a Set because it has $O(1)$ lookup.
- I refactored the next state calculation to make the code more readable.
